          <a>Exhaust</a>
          <p>An exhaust system of the internal combustion engine is provided, which includes an exhaust manifold mounted in a multiple cylinder engine of the internal combustion engine and configured to expel air burned in the cylinder when an exhaust valve is opened, a plurality of exhaust pipes connected to the exhaust manifold and configured to dispense an exhaust gas to the outside, a muffler and a plurality of exhaust balancers configured to function as a condenser are selectively mounted in the exhaust system so as to fill a part of the exhaust gas inside and then re-exhaust the filled exhaust gas when the exhaust is completed. The exhaust system improves a power of the engine by lowering exhaust pressure generated from exhaust resistance than that of the cylinder.

          <a>Cylinder</a>
          <p>A cylinder is the main body of IC engine. Cylinder is a part in which the intake of fuel, compression of fuel and burning of fuel take place. The main function of cylinder is to guide the piston. It is in direct contact with the products of combustion so it must be cooled. For cooling of cylinder, a water jacket (for liquid cooling used in most of cars) or fin (for air cooling used in most of bikes) are situated at the outer side of cylinder. At the upper end of cylinder, cylinder head and at the bottom end crank case is bolted. The upper side of cylinder is consisting a combustion chamber where fuel burns. To handle all this pressure and temperature generated by combustion of fuel, cylinder material should have high compressive strength. So it is made by high grade cast iron. It is made by casting and usually cast in one piece.
