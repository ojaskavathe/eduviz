          <a>Exhaust</a>
          <p>An exhaust system of the internal combustion engine is provided, which includes an exhaust manifold mounted in a multiple cylinder engine of the internal combustion engine and configured to expel air burned in the cylinder when an exhaust valve is opened, a plurality of exhaust pipes connected to the exhaust manifold and configured to dispense an exhaust gas to the outside, a muffler and a plurality of exhaust balancers configured to function as a condenser are selectively mounted in the exhaust system so as to fill a part of the exhaust gas inside and then re-exhaust the filled exhaust gas when the exhaust is completed. The exhaust system improves a power of the engine by lowering exhaust pressure generated from exhaust resistance than that of the cylinder.

        <li class="def-dropdown" id="Cylinder">
          <a>Cylinder</a>
          <p>A cylinder is the main body of IC engine. Cylinder is a part in which the intake of fuel, compression of fuel and burning of fuel take place. The main function of cylinder is to guide the piston. It is in direct contact with the products of combustion so it must be cooled. For cooling of cylinder, a water jacket (for liquid cooling used in most of cars) or fin (for air cooling used in most of bikes) are situated at the outer side of cylinder. At the upper end of cylinder, cylinder head and at the bottom end crank case is bolted. The upper side of cylinder is consisting a combustion chamber where fuel burns. To handle all this pressure and temperature generated by combustion of fuel, cylinder material should have high compressive strength. So it is made by high grade cast iron. It is made by casting and usually cast in one piece.

        <li class="def-dropdown" id="Piston">
          <a>Piston</a>
          <p>The piston is a cylindrical part that moves upward and downward in the cylinder, allowing the complete combustion cycle to take place (intake, compression, combustion, exhaust) check out how this process works below. The diameter of the piston is a bit less than the bore of the cylinder to avoid quick wear of the piston surface. There are three rings known as piston rings fitted in the circular recesses on the piston surfaces. These rings are made of aluminum, having direct contact with the cylinder liner, thus preventing piston wear.

        <li class="def-dropdown" id="Crankshaft">
          <a>Crankshaft</a>
          <p>A crankshaft is a rotating shaft that converts reciprocating motion of a piston into a rotational motion. Itâ€™s commonly used in internal combustion engines to perform such operation.  Crankshafts consist of series of cranks and crankpins to which the connecting rods are attached. A crankshaft with at least one shaft rotates within the engine block.  It rotates using the main bearings. The crankpins rotate within the connecting rods using rod bearings.
